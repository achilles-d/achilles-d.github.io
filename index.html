						</div>
						<div class="about-narrative-body">
							I first became interested in technology when I fixed up an old Dell Inspiron laptop in elementary school. Despite it running Windows XP at the time and only having 512MB of RAM, I was able to coax some video gameplay out of it and use it as my personal computer.<br> <br>
							In middle school, I put old computers to better use by installing Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Puppy Linux, and Crunchbang via USB disks and CDs/DVDs.
							At that time, I also installed a custom ROM (Operating System) and recovery on my Samsung Galaxy S3 - CyanogenMod and ClockWorkMod. <br> <br>
							In high school, I built my first desktop computer and also set up and installed all of the necessary software on it. I also became a Windows Insider to test Windows 10 beginning with the Technical Preview. 
							I also installed a custom ROM and recovery on my second phone, also an Android phone, which I still use today. <br> <br>
							As I college student, I set up and installed a custom head unit (stereo) in my car that runs Android, allowing me to use any app on the Play Store and Android Auto through an emulator as well. I also became part of the Duke Academy of Model Aeronautics to continue to pursue my interest in unmanned aerial systems, better known as drones. I am currently serving as AMA's President.
