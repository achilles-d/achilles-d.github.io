                            • This PAPR alternative may be constructed largely using off-the-shelf components and used to provide breathing protection to a higher degree than improvised face masks. <br>
                            • The design focuses on the powered filtration unit (blower) component of a full PAPR system. <br>
                            • Future work for this project includes streamlining the design for prototyping, conducting laboratory filtration and CO​2​ testing, and integrating the device with a PAPR hood system for full-system testing.<br>

                            • The Olympe API from Parrot allows our interface to communicate with the user's ANAFI. <br>
                            • For safety, arcade-style controls limit the motion of the drone to the direction that its camera is facing along with turning left and right. <br>

                            • All footage was captured in ANAFI's manual piloting mode; no cinematic assists were used. <br>
                            • Ground shots were captured using the Sony RX100 II that was stabilized by a handheld Joby Gorillapod. <br>
                            • All audio for drone shots was recorded separately using the Sony RX100 II given that the ANAFI cannot record audio. <br>
                            • All editing was done by me in Adobe Premiere Pro. <br>

                            • Features a dodecahedron, a 12-sided device wherein each face represents an activity set by the user. <br>
                            • When the user flips the device, the activity assigned to the face that is facing up will be logged by the companion application as the current activity that is in progress. The activity that was already being logged when the flip occurred will be logged as having ended. <br>
                            • Users can connect the app to their digital calendars to allow Timeturner to automatically find time in their schedule to schedule break times. <br>
                            • The companion app provides insights to users about how well they are managing their time relative to their schedules set in digital calendar services. <br>
                            • Both the project and presentations ("Share Outs") were selected by our professor to be used as examples of exemplary work in future semesters <br>

                            • Google's text-to-speech service is used to generate narration to describe what the device is seeing. <br>
                            • Although our vision is to make the application designed for mobile devices, the version seen in the video demo in the repo connects the user's smartphone to their desktop or laptop as an IP webcam, allowing that computer to analyze each image. <br>
                            • A future release would use a webserver to apply the model to each image captured by the user's smartphone. <br>
